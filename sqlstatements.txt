For Admin/manager
-Insert and remove products from product table.
INSERT INTO product VALUES ('upc', 'on_hand', 'product_name');
-make new locations
INSERT INTO location VALUES ('location_name');



For regular employee
-find product info and location from upc
SELECT * FROM product WHERE upc=072838311320;
SELECT * FROM location WHERE upc=072838311320;

-give a product a location. This first checks if there is a product already there. If so, it edits quantity. If not, it inserts a new line.
SELECT * FROM stocked_product WHERE upc=072838311320 AND location=A040324;
UPDATE stocked_product SET quantity='current+new' WHERE upc=072838311320 AND location=A040324;
or if not already in table
INSERT INTO stocked_product VALUES ('upc', 'location_name', 'quantity');
